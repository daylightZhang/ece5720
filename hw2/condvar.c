/******************************************************************************
* (1) The main thread creates three threads.                                  *
* (2 )Two of those threads increment a "count" variable,                      *
* (3) Third thread is locked and watches the value of "count".                *
* (4) When "count" reaches a predefined limit, the waiting thread is signaled *
*     by one of the incrementing threads.                                     *
* (5) The waiting thread "awakens" and then modifies count.                   *
* (6) The program continues until the incrementing threads reach TCOUNT.      *
* The main program prints the final value of count.                           *
* From B. Nichols and LLNL                                                    *
